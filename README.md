## Road map of c language
 
 getting started 
 
 1.History of the language :
 (https://www.section.io/engineering-education/history-of-c-programming-language/)


 2.Scope of this language :

 3.Road map of this language:


 1)Introduction to C Programming :
 The course will first teach you about program flow and how programming languages work with data, so that you can understand the basic architecture behind programming with C. The course then moves on to the most important elements of programming in C. These will include overviews and explanations of how to use crucial C functions, methods and routines. All of this will be outlined in clear and simple language and gone through in a step-by-step manner.

 2)Fundamentals of Numbers, Variables and Arrays :
 This course begins by discussing numbers, variables and arrays when programming in C. You will look into the basics of signed and unsigned numbers, the basics of numeric overflow, fractional numbers in binary, and numeric data types in C. You will also study the basics of ASCII and the char data type as well as learn how numbers are encoded as characters in ASCII. This course will also discuss the maximum values for unsigned integers in C and the minimum and maximum values of signed integers.

3)Using Pointers, Constants and Strings :
C is a powerful system programming language and is commonly used to programme operating systems such as Unix. With this course, you will learn that one of the main advantages of programming in C is that it allows the programmer to write directly to memory. This means that key constructs such as pointers, constants, and strings can be used within the memory in an efficient and machine-independent fashion. You will also look into the functions of the char pointer.

4)Statements and Logic :
This course begins by discussing statements and logic when programming in C. You will look into conditional flow statements and the mechanisms for control flow statements. You will learn that control flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function cells are executed within a piece of software. You will also learn how to implement a simple IF statement in C and look into the other functions of the IF statements and logical operators.
