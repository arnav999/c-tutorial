# iterative statments

Iteration statements are most commonly know as loops. Also the repetition process in C is done by using loop control instruction. 

## Types of iterative statments

1. for loop.(entry control loop)

2. while loop.(entry control loop)

3. do while loop.(exit control loop)


### 1) for loop 

For loop is the most commonly used looping technique. The reason why it is so popular is because it has all the three parts of the loop: initialization, test expression, update expression in the same line. 

   for(initialization; test expression; update expression)
     {
      //body of loop
     }
