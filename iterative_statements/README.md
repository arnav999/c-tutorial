# iterative statments

Iteration statements are most commonly know as loops. Also the repetition process in C is done by using loop control instruction. 

## Types of iterative statments

1. for loop.(entry control loop)

2. while loop.(entry control loop)

3. do while loop.(exit control loop)


### 1) for loop 

For loop is the most commonly used looping technique. The reason why it is so popular is because it has all the three parts of the loop: initialization, test expression, update expression in the same line. 

   for(initialization; test expression; update expression)

     {

      //body of loop

     }

### 2) while loop

While loop is also known as a pre-tested loop. In general, a while loop allows a part of the code to be executed multiple times depending upon a given boolean condition.

     while(condition){  
       //code to be executed  
     }

### 3) do while loop

Unlike for and while loops, which test the loop condition at the top of the loop, the do...while loop in C programming checks its condition at the bottom of the loop.

A do...while loop is similar to a while loop, except the fact that it is guaranteed to execute at least one time.

     do {
       statement(s);
     } 
      while( condition );
